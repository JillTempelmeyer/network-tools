# Speed Test

SpeedTest tests the upload and download bandwidth speeds between your IP address and any data center on the IBM Cloud network. If you're experiencing latency, using SpeedTest can help assess where the latency is located. The SpeedTest website is run using Adobe Flash Player. If you do not have Flash Player, refer to Adobe's site to [download ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html){:new_window} the appropriate version for your operating system.
