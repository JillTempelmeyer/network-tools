# Getting Started with Network Tools

Network tools enable customers to manage their own subnets and IPs within the global registration community and determine speed and latency between data centers. 

These tools include:
 * RIR registration and update tool
 * RWHOIS registration and update tool
 * Speed Test tool
 * Looking Glass tool
 
With these tools, you can also `ping` a device or host, check a domain's propagation status, perform a `traceroute`, and perform a `whois` query.
