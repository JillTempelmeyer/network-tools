# Use the RWhois Registration Tool

The RWhois Registration tool stores data associated with each account, including company details and contact information. This information is used when an RWhois query is made on a URL or any IP address associated with an account. You may update the details stored in the RWhois Registration tool at any time. Details can include the company information stored within the Customer Portal or custom details specified by authorized users on the account. The interface to the RWhois Registration tool is the RWhois Registration screen, which you can display by following these steps:

1. Log in to the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} using your unique credentials.
* Select **Network > IP Management > RWhois Registration** to display the RWhois Registration screen.

## What Happens Next

RWhois Registration details are stored and edited from the RWhois Registration screen. RWhois details may be [updated](update-rwhois.html) as often as necessary.
