# Use the RIR Registration Screen

The RIR Registration screen is the central location from which any subnet associated with an account may be registered with the [Regional Internet Registry (RIR) ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Internet_registry){:new_window}. Follow the steps below to utilize the RIR Registration screen.

1. Log in to the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} using your unique credentials.
* Select **Network > IP Management > RIR Registration** from the Navigation Bar to display the RIR Registration screen.

## What Happens Next

All subnets associated with the account are listed on the RIR Registration screen, along with their registration status and associated Person Record. From this screen, subnets may be [registered with the assigned RIR](register-subnet-rir.html), [registration information may be updated](update-registered-subnet.html) and a subnet's [RIR registration may be removed](register-subnet-rir.html). Additionally, you may add or view Person Records at any time.
