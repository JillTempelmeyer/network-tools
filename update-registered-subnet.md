# Update the Registration Information for a Registered Subnet

After a subnet has completed its initial RIR Registration, you may update the registration information for the subnet at any time. Follow the steps below to update the RIR Registration for a subnet.

1. Update the RWhois information with the details you wish to appear for the subnet you are updating. Refer to [Update the RWhois Information on an Account](update-rwhois.html){:new_window}
* Display the **RIR Registration** screen in the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}. Refer to [Use the RIR Registration Tool](rir-screen.html){:new_window}.
* Select **Update Registration** from the **Actions** dropdown list. An **Update RIR Registration** pop-up box will appear displaying the new information pulled from the RWhois update.
* Select the **Confirm** button to complete the update, or select the **Cancel** button to cancel the action.

## What Happens Next

After you confirm the update, the subnet's status  appears as **Registering** until the update has been completed by the RIR. Update times are not controlled internally, and they can vary based on the subnet's region.
