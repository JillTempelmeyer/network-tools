# Ping a Device

The Ping tool on the IBM Cloud Customer Portal requests an echo from the selected server. Ping is used to check some latency on communication links and to ensure that the specified server is active. Ping requests can be sent to IBM Cloud and external devices. Follow these steps to ping a device:

1. Navigate to the **Network Tools** interface on the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/).
* Enter the server name in the **Ping** field.
* Click the **Ping** button. Your results will appear on the right side of the screen.
