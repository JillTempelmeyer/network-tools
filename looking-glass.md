# About Looking Glass

[Looking Glass ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://lg.softlayer.com/){:new_window} is an interactive resource available to the public that can be used to test latency between {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} data centers and between a router location and target address, subnet or hostname. Looking Glass tests latency between a location and its target using various methods, including ping and traceroute commands, and it enables users to test network latency with a variety of test downloads based on size and data center location. Users operate Looking Glass under the premise that only manual queries will be made.
